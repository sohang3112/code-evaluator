Project Goals:
Part 1 (Minor):
Version 1 - make a simple server program to which a command based client program can connect and return compile/execute status (cte/rte etc). 
Version 2 - make the server multi-threaded.
Version 3 - convert the source code into a jar application that can be used in standalone mode. It should allow user to specify a folder for source code and another folder for test instances, and compile-execute-test all the source files and store the result in a properly formatted destination file (try to support csv/excel and pdf).
Part 2(Major):
Implement a MOSS-based application that does effective plag check and displays the plag percentage for all course code files, one row per file.
